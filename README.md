# foogallery-justified-infinite-scroll-template
Clone the existing "Justified" template, and add to it the ability to use the new functionality (addin in version 3.6 of the underlying Javascript) to add images to the gallery and to use the "norewind" option.

See [http://miromannino.github.io/Justified-Gallery/endless-scroll] for more information on it.

You can specify the number of images to include on the "initial" page as well as the number per page after that.  You can also choose to add more images on a scroll event or by having a button press.

First attempt at some of this, so it is still "in development"...
